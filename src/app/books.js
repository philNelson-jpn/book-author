			"On April 11, 2002, nearly a million Venezuelans marched on the presidential palace to demand the resignation of Hugo Chávez. The opposition represented a cross-section of society furious with Chávez's economic policies, specifically his mishandling of Venezuelan oil.",
			'As the day progressed, the march turned violent, sparking a military revolt that led to the temporary ousting of Chávez. Over the ensuing turbulent seventy-two hours, Venezuelans would confront the deep divisions within their society and ultimately decide the best course for their country and its oil in the new century.',
			'Drawing on unprecedented reporting, Nelson renders a mesmerizing account of the coup. An Economist Book of the Year, The Silence and the Scorpion provides rich insight into the complexities of modern Venezuela.',
